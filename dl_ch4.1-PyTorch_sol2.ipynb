    "In my last update, I was unable to train a model capable of recognising handwritten digits. The reason for this was mainly due to my inability to structure the data (a CSV file based on MNIST database) in such a manner that the mathematical operation necessary to train a model could be performed on it (see below for more details).\n",

To begin with, we have Howard and Guggen's partial solution (which is only capable of distinguishing 3s and 7s) that uses a different approach where direct greyscale labeled images are used and this project from Kaggle (which I have amended slightly) that uses the same CSV data I have but that trains the model with some features from PyTorch.\n",
